 * C#.NET I
 * 
 * Instructions
 * Take a look at the Rectangle class.
 * 1. How many instance variables does the class have?
 * 2. How many properties does the class have?
 * 3. How many constructors does the class have?
 * 4. How many methods does the class have?
 * 
 * Let's add the code to create three Rectangle objects in an array.
 * The first will have a length of 5 and 100, the second will have
 * a length and width of 10, and the final will have a length and
 * width of 20. Next, let's write the code to calculate the total
 * area and perimeter of all three rectangles and display the results
 * to the console. In addition, let's write the code to count the number
 * of rectangles that are actually squares.
 * 
 * Let's create a new class called Circle, which will represent 
 * a circle with a given radius. Let's use a property to store
 * the radius. We will write only one constructor, which accept
 * a radius and store it in the property. Additionally, we will write
 * three methods: Area(), Circumference(), and Diameter(). Obviously, we
 * should test our class by making some objects. Let's create a Circle
 * object with a radius of 5. We will then display the area, circumference,
 * and diameter of the circle to the console.
 * 
 * Finally, let's print each Rectangle object to the console and observe
 * the result. What method was called to display the objects?
